## Submission Note

According to the rubric, the project submission materials include...

<blockquote>
    3. A note summarizing:
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Each member’s attendance at group meetings, including in-class collaboration sessions and any additional meetings scheduled by the group.</li>
        <li>Each member’s contribution to the project as agreed upon by all members.</li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>

This section addresses and satisfies that material.

### Group Meetings

- **<ins>Wednesday, 1/21/2026</ins> <kbd>in-class</kbd>**
    - **Attendees:** Tim, Kat, Kyle, Camryn
    - **Absentees:** Brody

### Contributions

The commit history details who submitted which contributions.
Chances are, though that some commits will involve contributions from more than one person
(e.g., pair/mob programming on a single device).

When <ins>**multiple people contribute**</ins> to a commit,
a <ins>**comment**</ins> will be attached including the <ins>**names of any other involved contributor(s)**</ins>.

_Ahead of submission, a table will be added that summarizes each group member's contributions._

### Notes
When running the switches and hosts, pass in the corresponding MAC addresses as a command-line argument.
The rest of the attributes will come from the config file
